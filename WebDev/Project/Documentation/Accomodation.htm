            The Accomodation page has the different kinds of rooms or suites that my hotel offers.
            Starting from the top there is a Drop Down List and the user needs to select the
            type of room out of the three: Deluxe, Executive or Presidential. Depending on the
            selection, the image and description will be loaded. For achieving this, I have
            used Multiview control of ASP.NET. This control works in tandem with an embedded
            View control. Each View control acts as a content container, and behaves very much
            like a Panel or Canvas area. At run time, the MultiView control manages the View
            controls to ensure only one View is visible at a time. I used the ActiveViewIndex
            property of the MultiView control to specify which View should be visible at any
            particular time.

            The description has the amenities part which are the facilites that my hotel offers
            for each type of room. This has been given CSS so that it is printed as a double
            column list.
