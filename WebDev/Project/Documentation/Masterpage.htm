            In this project I have used a Master page called ProjMaster.master which provides
            the layout for all the pages of my project.</p>
        <p>
            It has a head ContentPlaceHolder for holding all the styles, scripts etc. that go
            into the head part of a web page. Apart from this, there is a header which contains
            the title of my project "Tushar Hotels and Projects" and the digital clock on the
            right. Then, after the header there is a vertical navigation which is floating left.
            Then next to it is another ContentPlaceHolder to hold the different contents as
            per the page. Below, there is footer of my project which has copyright note as well
            as on the rightmost bottom corner I have a link to the main homepage of my website.
        </p>
        <p>
            The navigation is provided on the master page so the user can navigate from any
            page to any other page!</p>
        <p>
            The image for my hotel name has been designed using the website <a href="http://www.flamingtext.com/All-Logos/page15"
                target="_blank">www.flamingtext.com/All-Logos</a></p>
        <p>
            The digital clock and the vertical navigation are the experiments that I had performed
            and I have made use of them in the master page. I have used gradient property of
            CSS3 in achieving the background color for the header which again was another experiment
            that I had performed.</p>
