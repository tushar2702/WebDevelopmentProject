        <p>
            Coming to the end of this course, I would definitely like to take out time to mention
            that it has been one of the best course for me so far and a very wonderful experience
            to learn so many new technologies in just one course. Where I hardly had some glimpse
            of basic HTML and CSS, I now can rightly say that I know most web technologies and
            that too to create a website on my own. And yes it is because of Prof. Richard Rasala.
            I would therefore like to thank Prof. Richard Rasala and Prof. Harriet Fell for
            sharing their experience and a great amount of knowledge with us.
        </p>

            I would also like to thank the Teaching Assistants to be there to help us throughout
            the course and for their weekly feedbacks on our progress. A special thanks to Prasad
            Chawan for guiding me throughout the course. Hope all of you like my work!
