        Reservation - 3 (Rewards)</h2>

        <p>
            I also maintain rewards for each user. I give one point for every booking and there
            are coupons for minimum number of points. The user can view the coupons he is eligible
            for redeeming. I have two tables in my database for achieving this. One is "Points"
            table with the username and the number of points he has gained till now. The other
            table is the "Coupon" table with the coupon code, the description and the minimum
            number of points that is required to redeem the coupon.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have written this code in SQL query and I have used a join on the two tables Coupon
            and Points to display the code description and mimimum points. So for this I need
            to display only the information for that user (based on the username from the Points
            table) and for the condition that the user must have the minimum number of points
            i.e. to compare the points in the Points table with the min points in the Coupon
            Table. I have also displayed the current points that the user has gained by writing
            another SQL query to retrieve the current points from the Points table for the user
            that is logged in.
