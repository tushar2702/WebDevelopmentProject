            My homepage has a JQuery slideshow where few images of the hotel keep rotating or
            sliding. This was one of the experiment I had performed but I have made a small
            change. In the experiment I had used slideToggle property of JQuery Effects but
            here I have used fadeIn and fadeOut properties instead since it was looking better
            for the project homepage. Then there is a description about my hotel below the image
            slideshow. Then on the right, I have an information bar which is floating right
            and it has important information about the hotel.
