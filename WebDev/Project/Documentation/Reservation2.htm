        Reservation - 2 (Retrieve Booking)</h2>

            The users can also retrieve their past bookings that they have made with us! On
            the Retrieve page, I have initially hidden all the booking details of the user.
            Once he clicks on "Click here to show your bookings" the panel will slide down to
            show the user his bookings. And the text will change to "Click here to hide your
            bookings". I have used JQuery to achieve this.
        </p>

            Now the main part was to retrieve the booking depending on what the username is.
            I have used LINQ to achieve this. I have written a LINQ query where I have used
            a join condition on my two tables Rooms and BookedRooms. It matches the username
            with which the person is logged in and retrieves his details such as checkin and
            checkout time and the room type he has booked.
