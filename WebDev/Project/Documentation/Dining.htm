            At Tushar Hotels and Resorts I also have dining services with 5 five-star restaurants.
            On this page at the top, I have used a slideshow but this time it is not JQuery
            but AJAX Slideshow which I had performed an experiment on. Then below I show the
            different kinds of cuisines that I offer. I do this by storing this data in an XML
            file and then I use ASP.NET Repeater Control to retrieve data from this XML file.
            Also I have a link for top special meals that I suggest.
        </p>
        <p>
            On this page, I have a drop down list to select a particular restaurant and then
            depending on the user's selection, top 3 special meals are shown again as a GridView.
            For this I had stored these values in the database and I retrieve using SQL.
