<p>You have just read about my project "Tushar Hotels and Resorts" which is basically hotel reservations, bookings 
and the various services and facilities that we offer. So I won't bore you by writing everything again. But I would 
definitely like to mention that I have kept my entire documentation short and sweet and at the same time I take care of
not missing out on any important information. I have also provided screenshots wherever required. So, enjoy reading!</p>
