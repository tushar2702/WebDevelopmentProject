        Reservation - 1 (Check Room Availability)</h2>
    <hr />
    <br />
    <div class="fs130">
        <p>
            Check availability lets user check the available rooms during the period he wishes
            to stay at our hotel. They need to enter checkin and checkout dates which are text
            boxes having JQuery datepicker. I have also performed validations on them. So, you
            won't be able to see any date before today's date in Checkin and you won't be able
            to see any date less than the checkin date in the Checkout field. The user also
            needs to choose room type and number of guests. To preserve the values the user
            enters in the checkin and checkout fields, I have used HTML5 Session storage.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have two tables in my database pertaining to this. One is "Room" table which shows
            the rooms that are there in the hotel with details such as room number and type
            of room. The second table is "Booked_Room" which has all the rooms that are booked.
            This has columns such as room number, checkin date, checkout date and username.
            I have achieved this using SQL Query and hence I can retrieve the number of available
            rooms of the selected type. Once that is done the user can go ahead and confirm
            his booking.

        </p>
        <p>
            On the Confirm Booking page, the user is shown all the details he selected as well
            as few of his personal details such as username, first name and last name. This
            is achieved by using session variables. Once he verifies this, he can click on confirm
            booking button and thus confirm his stay! For this I have used SQL to insert the
            data in Booked_Room Table.

        </p>
        <p>
            Finally once the room is booked, the user can have an email notification sent to
            his email address. I have used System.net.mail namespace for sending emails to the
            users. In this email, I have fixed the subject which is the name of my hotel and
            body which are the details about the bookings of the user. Also, the from part is
            fixed which is my test gmail address that I am using for this website.
