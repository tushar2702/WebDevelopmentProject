            On the careers page, the users may wish to search for jobs, apply online and upload
            their resume. I have a few pages to accomplish this.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the first page, to search for jobs the user can see two drop down lists one for
            selecting the job title and the other one for selecting one of our locations and
            then click on job search. These drop down lists are populated using SQL Data Source.
            I have stored few jobs for these combinations in the database. If there is a match
            for the combination that the user supplied, I write a LINQ Query to retrieve this
            data from the database and display it using ASP.NET GridView. Below there is a button
            which will take the user to the Online Application page. This button becomes visible
            only if a match is obtained.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second page is an online application form for the applicants. I have text fields
            such as name, email address, country, city, state, zip code, phone number and work
            experience. I have used ASP.NET Validators for all of these including RequiredFieldValidators
            and RegularExpressionValidators. I have used most of my experiment on ASP.NET validation
            here. The user can submit the application and once it is submitted he is redirected
            to the resume upload page which is the last page.
        </p>
        <p>
            On this page, the user is given the option to upload his resume. I have made use
            of ASP.NET File Upload control and I had also performed an experiment on this. 
            The desired file gets uploaded in the ~/UploadedFiles directory.</p>
