        <p>
            On the Contact Us page, I have provided basic contact information. I have also shown
            how to reach us on Google Maps by embedding the Google Map with the marker set at
            the place where we are located. I have used Northeastern University address as a
            dummy address for my hotel.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have two other pages associated with it. One is sending feedback. The user
            can send me feedback about my hotel by entering information such as his or her name,
            email address, subject and comments about my hotel. Here I have used System.net.mail
            namespace and the email will be sent to my gmail address that I created for this
            website xyz1abc23@gmail.com.
        </p>
        <p>
            One more thing that I have shown here is a google widget which gives the user directions
            from the location he enters to the hotel.
