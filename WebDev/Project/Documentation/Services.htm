            The services page has all the services such as the swimming pool, fitness centre,
            in-hotel shops, airport pickups and spa. I have used clean CSS for this page and
            have shown images and a small description about each service. I float each image
            and its respective description to the left so that the next image is next to the
            previous one. I have also provided good hovering effect where the image expands
            a little when hovered. This is achieved using the CSS3 Transition property.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user can also view the detailed description about each page by clicking on either
            the image or the Read More link provided below. Here for each service I have a different
            page.
