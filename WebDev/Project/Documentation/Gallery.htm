            I have also provided a photo gallery of all the beautiful pictures of my hotel.
            I have used JQuery for this. Apart from my other slideshows that I have used in
            my project, this one is very different. This one is user interactive which allows
            the user to hit the right or the left arrow to move the images. I have also used
            a lot of CSS which helps me accomplish this photo gallery. Apart from all this,
            I also fade the background when the user clicks on "View Photo Gallery" to give
            a good look to the page. It is kind of like a pop up which opens over the black
            faded background.
