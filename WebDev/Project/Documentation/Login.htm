        Login and Register</h2>

    <div class="fs130">
        <p>
            The Login page contains the login Control and link for user registration if user
            is not already registered. I have used login control of asp.net for the project.
            Once the user is logged in, he will be redirected to a LoggedIn page "loggedin.aspx"
            where he can choose to do 3 things: whether to check availability of rooms and book
            them, retrive his past bookings or also track the reward points he has gained until
            now and the coupons that he is eligible to use. If the user is already loggedin,
            and clicks on the Reservations tab he will be redirected on this loggedin page.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have also taken care of one important thing. That is if the user is logged in
            and he opens several tabs when logged in, then when he presses the logout button,
            he should not be given access to any of the pages and should be redirected back
            to the login page. I have achieved this by writing some code in C#.</p>
        <p>
            While attempting to login, I have also provided an image showing that the logging
            in task is in process. I have used an Update Progress control to accomplish this.
            I created this image with the help of this website <a href="http://ajaxload.info/"
                target="_blank">http://ajaxload.info/</a></p>
        <img alt="Login" src="../images/documentation/login.png" width="800" height="400" />
        <p>
            User is redirected to the Register page if he is not already a member. Once he has
            successfully registered and he clicks on continue he will be redirected to the loggedin
            page. This is again the ASP.NET CreateUserWizard Control that I have used. I also
            maintain a profile for each user by making necessary additions to the web.config
            file and I save the user's first name and last name to the profile.
        </p>
