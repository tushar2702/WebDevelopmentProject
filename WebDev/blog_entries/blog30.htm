        Over the weekend, I also learnt about the Google Map API and how to use it to 
        embed google maps to web pages. In this experiment I first got an API key as 
        explained in the Google maps documentation/tutorial. Once that was done, I added 
        the javascript file with the key that I received.</p>
    <p>
        For embedding the map, I have a div with id &quot;map_canvas&quot;. I have given it a 
        width and height and border too. Now, in the body tag I have onLoad function 
        which is called when the body is loaded. In that function, I set the options for 
        the map. i.e. its center(latitude and longitude I want to display at the center 
        of the map), its zoom level and mapTypeId. Once that is done, I created map 
        variable and assigned all the options to it. The location(latitude and 
        longitude) that I have set is 440 Huntington Avenue(Northeastern University) 
        02115. Also, I created a marker to point to this desired location. I also added 
        content (text and image) to it.</p>
    <p>
        I geocoded the address using geocoder.us and the image of Northeastern 
        University was obtained from Google Images.</p>
