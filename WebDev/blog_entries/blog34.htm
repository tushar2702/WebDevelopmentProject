        Further in my project...</p>
    <p>
        After implementing the logic for booking hotel rooms, I went on to implement the 
        retrieval of different rooms that the user has booked over a period of time. So, 
        when a user is logged in he just needs to click on the link to retrieve data 
        related to the bookings he has made in the past. For implementing this logic, I 
        have written a LINQ query where I have used a join condition on my two tables 
        Rooms and BookedRooms. It matches the username with which the person is logged 
        in and retrieves his details such as checkin and checkout time and the room type 
        he has booked.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the &quot;Retrieve&quot; page, I have used a jquery experiment, where the user is asked 
        to click on the panel which says &quot;Click here to display your bookings&quot; and the 
        bookings will be displayed. The text now changes to &quot;Click here to hide your 
        bookings&quot; and when clicked will hide the details! and the text again changes. 
        This is so cool! I hope you like it...</p>
