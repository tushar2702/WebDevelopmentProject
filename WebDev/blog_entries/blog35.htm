        The next feature that I had thought of implementing is the Rewards that the 
        customer gets when he books rooms in my hotel. The first thing was the database 
        design. I have two tables in my database for achieving this. One is &quot;Points&quot; 
        table with the username and the number of points he has gained till now. The 
        other table is the &quot;Coupon&quot; table with the coupon code, the description and the 
        minimum number of points that is required to redeem the coupon.</p>
    <p>
        I have written this code in SQL query and I have used a join on the two tables 
        Coupon and Points to display the code description and mimimum points. So for 
        this I need to display only the information for that user (based on the username 
        from the Points table) and for the condition that the user must have the minimum 
        number of points i.e. to compare the points in the Points table with the min 
        points in the Coupon Table.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have also displayed the current points that the user has gained by writing 
        another SQL query to retrieve the current points from the Points table for the 
        user that is logged in.</p>
