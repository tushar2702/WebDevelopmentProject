        Further in my project...<br /> I wanted to make a photo gallery of all the beautiful 
        images of my hotel. I used JQuery slideshow to build it. Apart from my other 
        slideshows that I have used in my project, this one is very different. This one 
        is user interactive which allows the user hit the right or the left arrow to 
        move the images. I have also used a lot of CSS which helps me accomplish this 
        photo gallery. Apart from all this, I also fade the background to give a good 
        look to the page. It is kind of like a pop up which opens over the black faded 
        background. This looks cool. Hope you all like it! There are still some issues 
        with the CSS which I will need to fix. So you can still wait for the final one 
        to be up and running! </p>
    <p>
        Apart from the project work, I also performed a couple of 
        experiments. The first one is a Page Hits Counter. This experiment I performed 
        out of curiosity to learn how to maintain the counter of the number of hits a 
        page has received. It was interesting to perform this experiment. What happens 
        is, when a user visits this page, the counter increments by one displaying the 
        number of page hits! </p>
    <p>
        Basically, I used an XML file called counter.xml and 
        initially set the count to zero. Now, whenever there is a page load, I first 
        retrieve the value from the xml file, increment it by one and then write it back 
        to the xml file and then finally display it! Isn&#39;t this easy!! </p>
    <p>
        The second one is 
        to demonstrate the insertion of data in database using LINQ. I performed this 
        because I wanted to use this in my project. In this experiment, first I created 
        a table called LINQTest in my database with columns ID, Name and Location. Then 
        I dragged and dropped this table in the previously created tushar27.dbml file 
        for my previous LINQ Experiment. </p>
    <p>
        Then I made the basic layout with text boxes 
        and labels and a button called &quot;insert data&quot; in which I write the entire code. 
        Initially I set the id to 1 if it is the firstid or else increment the id by 
        one. Then, I create an object named test1 which holds the name and location from 
        the input textboxes which the user provides. Then I insert using 
        InsertOnSubmit() and finally I submit the changes by calling the function 
        SubmitChanges(). I then, set the label to &quot;Successfully inserted&quot; and also 
        display the data using GridView control.</p>
