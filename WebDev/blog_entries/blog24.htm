        One of the most important experiments - login and register. In the login page I 
        have demonstrated the use of login control in ASP.NET. The credentials that are 
        required to log in to the page is being stored in SQL Server and the &quot;Register&quot; 
        page is there for you to register yourself in the database. Once you are 
        registered, you can go ahead and login. When you are logged in the text will 
        change to Logout and you can click on logout. First, you need to modify the 
        authentication tag in web.config and then add membership tag. Then create a 
        ASP.NET login control and add login view control to it.Further we need to run 
        ASP.NET configuration. For the steps you can check the link above. It is 
        beautiful and perfect. I really need to thank Gautam Naik for such a beautiful 
        description on how to use login and register.</p>

        In the register page, I have demonstrated the use of createUserWizard control in 
        ASP.NET and allows new users to register themselves in the database. You can try 
        registering yourself here and then make use of the login experiment to login 
        yourself and see a welcome message with your name printed. This is a very 
        important experiment from the point of view of my project.
