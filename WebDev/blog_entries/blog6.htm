        Added one basic experiment which is to expand or collapse list-items using 
        JQuery Effects. After having read basic JQuery from W3Schools, I wanted to try 
        this!</p>
    <p>
        I want to try the same experiment in Javascript without using the JQuery 
        library. I don&#39;t know how easy or complicated it would be but if I am able to do 
        it, it will be up sometime next week!!
