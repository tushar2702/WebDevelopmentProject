        My photogallery had some CSS issues. After great efforts, I have finally 
        resolved all of them. CSS is so beautiful but dangerous. If you start wrong and 
        have a lot of issues it is better to start again rather than trying to fix them, 
        or you will end up completely wrong!</p>

        I also created the Careers page for the applicants who desire to work with us. 
        On the careers page, the users may wish to search for jobs, apply online and 
        upload their resume. On the first page, to search for jobs the user can see two 
        drop down lists one for selecting the job title and the other one for selecting 
        one of our locations and then click on job search. These drop down lists are 
        populated using SQL Data Source. I have stored few jobs for these combinations 
        in the database. If there is a match for the combination that the user supplied, 
        I write a LINQ Query to retrieve this data from the database and display it 
        using ASP.NET GridView. I used my experiments on LINQ to achieve this.

        The second page is an online application form for the applicants. I have text 
        fields such as name, email address, country, city, state, zip code, phone number 
        and work experience. I have used ASP.NET Validators for all of these including 
        RequiredFieldValidators and RegularExpressionValidators. I have used most of my 
        experiment on ASP.NET validation here.</p>
    <p>
        The user may also upload his resume. I have made use of ASP.NET File Upload 
        control and I had also performed an experiment on this. The only advancement I 
        have done here is that I have used a RegularExpressionValidator for the File 
        Upload Control and hence the user can upload only .doc, .docx, .pdf files.</p>
