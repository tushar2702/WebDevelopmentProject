        Further in my project....</p>
    <p>
        Once the availability of rooms is done, the user can see the number of rooms of 
        the selected type. If there are no rooms, he/she cannot proceed with booking and 
        I have achieved this by hiding the button initially. Once atleast a single room 
        of the selected type is available, the user can proceed with booking where I 
        redirect the user to a page where he/she needs to confirm his/her details. Once 
        the user clicks on confirm booking button, an insert query is fired which 
        inserts the room number and other details in the Booked_Room table which holds 
        all the rooms that have been booked alongwith the username who have booked them. 
        I have used SQL to write the insert query and it was pretty simple. It all 
        worked awesome because of the database that I designed. All is well till now :)</p>
