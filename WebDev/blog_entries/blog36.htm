        Today I learnt about ASP.NET repeater control. I wanted to know how to read an 
        XML file and display it using ASP.NET Repeater so that I can use this for my 
        project!
    </p>
    <p>
        I came across a control called Repeater in ASP.NET which has certain tags such 
        as HeaderTemplate, ItemTemplate and FooterTemplate. Now first you need an XML 
        file that you want to read. You need to create an instance of DataSet and read 
        the xml file using this instance. Then, drag and drop the asp.net repeater and 
        bind that to the datasource i.e. the xml file.</p>
    <p>
        Once this is in place, to bind data in the ItemTemplate,use this code: <code>
        DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem, [name of the data item in xml file])</code> 
        and you are done! Isn&#39;t this awesome!</p>

        Also for my project, I designed the &quot;Contact Us&quot; page where I have put contact 
        information about me (the owner of Tushar Hotels and Resorts). In this I have 
        used Google Map experiment that I had performed to point to the location of my 
        hotel and set a marker over there. I have also used the google widget which 
        gives you directions to the Hotel. Also on the contact page, I have a link to 
        send feedback. By clicking on this a new page is opened and you need to fill in 
        your name, your email address , subject and comments and then submit to send me 
        an email at the email address that I have created for this course
        <a href="mailto:xyz1abc23@gmail.com">xyz1abc23@gmail.com</a>...
