        ASP.NET has such a varied range of controls which have various advantages over 
        other languages. Now validation in Javascript required us to write a lot of code 
        for validating each and every field and that had to be done individually for 
        every field. This was so tedious. ASP.NET has validators which simplifies the 
        task of validation. I studied validators such as RequiredFieldValidator(to 
        enforce something to be entered in the field), RangeValidator(to check the range 
        of values), RegularExpressionValidator(to check for the validity of an 
        expression such as phone number and email address in proper format).</p>
    <p>
        In the experiment, I have demonstrated each of these validators and I also used 
        the Calendar control of ASP.NET to demonstrate range validator. The range 
        validator has properties such as MinimumValue and MaximumValue which sets the 
        range to be checked. For today&#39;s date I used DateTime.Now() and for a week&#39;s 
        date from today I used DateTime.Now.AddDays(7). The calendar control has various 
        properties such as selectionMode which lets you select a particular date or the 
        entire week and so on.</p>
