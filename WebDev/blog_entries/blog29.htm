    <p>
        I wanted to try the UpdateProgress control in ASP.NET since I was thinking to 
        use it in my project. It will be used when the person/user is trying to login to 
        a particular page. I always wanted to perform this experiment but I thought of 
        it as being a difficult experiment but when I got to know about AJAX controls 
        such as UpdatePanel and UpdateProgress, my thoughts were proved wrong.</p>
    <p class="content" 
        style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
        Here, I have used the UpdatePanel control which holds the button &quot;Click to view 
        updated time&quot; which is associated with the UpdateProgress control of AJAX. This 
        control has a ProgressTemplate which includes what should appear when the 
        aynchronous call is being made. In this I have included the image which I got 
        from this website http://ajaxload.info/. When the page is refreshed I make the 
        system sleep for 2 seconds so that you can see the image animation while the 
        system is processing and then you can view the updated time.</p>
