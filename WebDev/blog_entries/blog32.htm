        I had problems initially with the Email experiment that I had put. It was 
        sending emails on the client but when I posted my experiment on the server, it 
        didn&#39;t work. The problem was that I did not set the credentials and also the 
        host name and port number that I included did not work on server. I had to 
        change both of them so that they work when uploaded on the server. It is fixed 
        now!!</p>

        I have also used this experiment on the booking page under &quot;Reservations&quot;. Once 
        the reservation is done, the user will be asked to fill in his username if he 
        wants an email confirmation of his booking. In this email, I have fixed the 
        subject which is the name of my hotel and body which are the details about the 
        bookings of the user. Also, the from part is fixed which is my test gmail 
        address that I am using for this website. The user just needs to enter his email 
        address and it will be sent to him. This is so wonderful!! :)</p>
