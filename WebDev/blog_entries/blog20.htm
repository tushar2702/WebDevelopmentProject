        I started thinking on the design of my web pages and I felt the need of using 
        Multiviews of ASP.NET. In the experiment, I used a drop down list to hold the 
        different list items as the views of the multiview tag. Then I had 3 views: 
        Calendar with red,green and yellow color! When view 1 is selected in drop down 
        list, calendar with red color is displayed, when view2 is selected calendar with 
        green color is shown and so on.. I would be using this multiview control in my 
        project.</p>

        At the end of the experiment, I realised that when I select a particular value 
        in the drop down menu, the entire page gets refreshed and this doesn&#39;t seem to 
        be nice! So, I thought of using AJAX update panel control to update only the 
        controls in the panel. This really works awesome! I hope you find it good 
        too.... LINQ would be next if I don&#39;t think much about the look and feel of my 
        project web pages for the time being! :)</p>
