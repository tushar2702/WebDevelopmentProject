        After the &quot;Accomodations&quot; page for my project was done, I started working on the 
        &quot;Services&quot; page that are the services offered by my hotel. This includes a few 
        categories like the swimming pool, fitness centre, spa etc. and I was thinking 
        of a way to represent these and I didn&#39;t want to use Multiviews since I had 
        already used it for the &quot;Accomodations&quot; page.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, I thought of using images for each category and a small description. Now if 
        you want to explore a particular service in detail, you would have to click on 
        the respective image or link and go to that page for further details. It&#39;s quite 
        simple but interesting.</p>
    <p>
        Each image in the &quot;Services&quot; page is floating left and this makes me arrange all 
        the image div&#39;s as I want. I have used basic CSS to make this!!</p>
    <p>
        I am currently gathering information and writing few things about the details of 
        all services. For now, the main &quot;Services&quot; page is ready! Next, I will add the 
        details of each service as another web page. Hope you all like it so far! If 
        not, feel free to contact me :)</p>
