        This week, I tried connecting remotely to SQL Server 2005. Initially, it took me 
        a lot of time getting the connection right. There were few problems that I faced 
        while the connection was being set up and even after the connection was made. It 
        took quite some time to set up the connection strings. But, it was Prof. 
        Rasala&#39;s links on how to establish the connection and about connection strings 
        that helped me get everything in place. A special thanks to &quot;Shweta Memane&quot; for 
        helping me out throughout this!!! :)</p>
    <p>
        Once the connection was ready, I wanted to test the connection. So, I performed 
        an experiment for this. I simply created a table in the database and retrieved 
        the data in the asp.net gridview control. This was also explained on Prof. 
        Rasala&#39;s Website.
