        Further in my project, I had gathered information about the various &quot;Services&quot; 
        that my hotel is going to offer - such as swimming pool, fitness centre, etc. 
        Finally I created web pages for each page and I have added the information about 
        every service. Information about the service , the operating hours and the 
        location are added on each page. Much more to come...
