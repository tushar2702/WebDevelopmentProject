        Performed two experiments on CSS:</p>
    <ul>
    <li> Vertical Navigation using CSS: I played around with the transition property of CSS3. Also used other CSS3 properties that 
    I had recently learned. </li>
    <li> Maze using CSS3 Animation: I learnt the animation feature in CSS3 and I wanted to try an experiment on it.
    Initially, I had something else in mind. Probably, I was going to show
        a ball and its motion around a path.
        But, then I thought of a maze. And this experiment was very simple. It demonstrates the basic -webkit-animation and
        @-webkit-keyframes property. I have also added the other browsers support CSS. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    My last CSS experiments for now! I will study more about Javascript and JQuery now. :)
