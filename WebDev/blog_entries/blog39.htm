        I was testing the Reservation page of my project and I came across a problem. 
        Under reservation, the user firstly needs to check for availability of rooms. 
        So, the checkin and checkout date initially are empty. If the user entered the 
        checkin and checkout dates, he used to get the available rooms if any and the 
        dates used to go away. I used to keep track of these dates in session variables 
        and then use them and display it on the next page. If now the user clicks on 
        check availability button again, the session variables have blank dates and they 
        are not passed onto the next page. I tried many things but finally it was HTML5 
        Web Storage to the rescue and it helped me preserve these values in the 
        respective textboxes!

        For achieving this, I also performed an experiment on HTML5 Web Storage to get a 
        better understanding of it. In this experiment, I have shown that there are two 
        types of storages. Session storage maintains a session and I store the number of 
        hits for a page. This sessionStorage will forget the count of hits once the page 
        is closed. As opposed to the Session Storage, there is another type of storage 
        called LocalStorage which stores the number of hits on your current local 
        browser. Hence, if you close the page and then reopen it again, it will still 
        remember the count and display to you the number of hits to the page. I use 
        javascript to write the code when the window is loaded and I make use of 
        sessionStorage.hits and localStorage.hits to get the number of hits. I increment 
        it by one everytime the page is loaded.

        I also had created About My Project page where I have given a short description 
        of my project before you actually go to the project homepage.</p>
