        Finally its there! I have started with my project and it is called &quot;Tushar 
        Hotels and Resorts&quot; for now. I might change the name later on! So, let&#39;s talk 
        about it and how much I have done so far!</p>
    <p>
        I had the idea in mind. I put that on paper and designed the layout of my web 
        pages, specially my homepage. It took me a lot of time developing the homepage 
        because there were minor bugs. Although the image slider, the digital clock on 
        the right hand side top corner of the page and the vertical navigation didn&#39;t 
        take time since it was already there in my experiments. I just had to copy and 
        paste MY code and it was ready. WOW!!! Isn&#39;t this amazing.....</p>
    <p>
        I am still thinking of improving the homepage but at a later stage. For now, I 
        think its good! Once I designed my homepage, I started with the next page, that 
        is hotel accomodations and rooms. For my project, there are 3 different kinds of 
        rooms and for that I used a drop down list to choose from. Now this is the 
        entire reason why I had this multiview asp.net control experiment with AJAX 
        update panel control. This page used that experiment entirely and thus one web 
        page for accomodations was enough to display the description of three different 
        types of rooms. Isn&#39;t this amazing too!!!!</p>
    <p>
        It was real fun in developing these web pages and I am sure you will like it. 
        Feel free to give me any kind of feedback to improve my homepage! That&#39;s all for 
        now.. Thanks!!
