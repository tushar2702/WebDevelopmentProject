        I have started working on my homepage and added some design to it using HTML and 
        CSS.</p>
    <p>
        I searched a lot of websites for a good layout and color combination and found a 
        great one at &quot;<a 
            href="http://we-own.net/demo/?preview_theme=PersonalBlogWordpressTheme">http://we-own.net/demo/?preview_theme=PersonalBlogWordpressTheme</a>&quot;. 
        So I used the background images and the color code for developing my website.
    </p>
    <p>
        I didn&#39;t know it would take so much time just to add the background and the 
        banner! There is still more to be added...</p>
