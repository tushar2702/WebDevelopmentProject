        Studied basic ASP.NET and a little bit about C#. Performed one experiment 
        demonstrating basic ASP.NET tools like label, textbox and RadioButtonList. This 
        experiment also demonstrates basic string handling in C#</p>
    <p>
        I am enjoying learning ASP.NET. Will put up a few more experiments by the end of 
        the week. This was just the start!!&nbsp; :))</p>
