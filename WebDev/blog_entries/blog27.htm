        I have already performed the slideshow experiment using JQuery. I wanted to try 
        how AJAX works when I try to implement this. It&#39;s much easier and you can use 
        asp:AsyncPostBackTrigger so that after every tick only the update panel is 
        refreshed. The entire page need not be refreshed. This is what is the most 
        important thing for websites now.</p>
    <p>
        I used the update panel to hold the images(one image at a time). The asp:Timer 
        is used to make an event occur every tick. The tick can be set to occur every n 
        seconds. For my example, it occurs every two seconds. Finally I had to use the 
        asp:AsyncPostBackTrigger so that the update panel will do its task 
        asynchronously.</p>
