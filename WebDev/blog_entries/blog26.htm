        I had developed the homepage and the services page of my projects. Now, I 
        started with the most important &quot;RESERVATIONS&quot; page. This would take a lot of 
        time to develop and that&#39;s why it was important in the beginning itself of what 
        is required and how the reservation pages look like. So, I started with pen and 
        paper and designed the initial look of the Reservations page. Once that was 
        done, I started working on it using ASP.NET, HTML and CSS. I used a few of my 
        experiments CSS which helped me make the rounded text boxes and give shadows 
        using box-shadow property of CSS3. So it was a lot of reuse of my existing 
        knowledge of CSS.</p>

        Now, for the Check-in date and Check-out date, I wanted to use a datepicker and 
        therefore Jquery&#39;s datepicker was the best to use. So, I added the jquery ui 
        library through google apis. I thought this was pretty easy and would work in 
        the first try itself. But, it didn&#39;t. This is because there are problems when we 
        use asp:textbox in child pages of existing master pages. The child page controls get 
        strange id names and hence instead of using #id_name I need to use
        input[id$=&#39;id_name&#39;]. Or alternatively, I can use HTML text box rather 
        than ASP.NET text boxes. And that worked!!! It was this link that helped me 
        understand why such problems occur

        Next would be the functionality of the Reservation page where I will start with 
        checking the availability of existing rooms according to the room type selected 
        by the user. </p>
