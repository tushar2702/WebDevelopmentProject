        I was thinking about my project homepage which I was designing on paper. And I 
        wanted to use a slideshow on the homepage. So, I thought of demonstrating an 
        experiment for the same.</p>
    <p>
        I made a slideshow div and added all the images that I wanted to use for the 
        slideshow. Then, I gave CSS for that div and all the images within that. Then, I 
        wrote the JQuery behind it where I call the slideshow function every 5 seconds. 
        Finally I gave the slideToggle() effect of JQuery for image transitions. I tried 
        various effects but I loved this one. For more details, you can check my 
        documentation and comments for the experiment.&nbsp;
