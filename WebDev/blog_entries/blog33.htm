        Today, I was playing with css to improve the look and feel of my website. I have 
        tried to refine a little how my webpage looks. What all changes I did today??</p>
    <p>
        On my web pages, I have a container which is the part other than the header and 
        the footer. Previously, it occupied 100% of the space. But it didn&#39;t look so 
        good. So, I changed its width property to 85% and now it looks decent. I also 
        played around with various color combinations to make my website look better. In 
        the previous version I had a green shade of navigation. I changed it to blue to 
        match the logo that I have put up for my hotel name. I also tried playing around 
        with various fonts and most of them look nice. Still have to decide to choose a 
        font across my web pages. Also used gradient property to give the background a 
        color gradient and gave a shadow effect to the container using box-shadow 
        property of css. Hope you like it. If there are any better suggestions, please 
        let me know! :)</p>
