        Fixed the bugs in my homepage. It used to get skewed in Firefox because I didn&#39;t 
        take care of the -moz properties in CSS and there were other issues as well. But 
        all fixed! Now it works properly in Firefox.</p>

        Also, I performed another ASP.NET experiment where I demonstrated the AdRotator 
        control in ASP.NET and the use of XmlDataSource control to link the xml file 
        with the ad rotator. It was nice learning about this!</p>
