        This weekend, I worked on LINQ and studied the basic concepts of how LINQ works 
        and how basic queries are written in LINQ. The more important thing that I 
        learnt is how to use Linq-to-sql classes and make connection with the database 
        as well as use these classes with auto generated code. If you want to learn a 
        step by step process of how to get connected with LINQ and basic things on linq, 
        it is best to refer to Prof. Rasala&#39;s LINQ notes on his site. It&#39;s beautiful and 
        systematic. Follow each and every step and you won&#39;t fail.</p>

        For my experiment that demonstrates the use of LINQ, I used Northwind database 
        and basic queries of selecting particular columns from specific tables of the 
        Northwind database. Fairly simple experiment but good to start with LINQ.
