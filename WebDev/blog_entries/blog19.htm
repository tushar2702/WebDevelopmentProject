        More on SQL: This week I also performed a few experiments demonstrating access 
        and manipulation of data in database. I made use of&nbsp; the SELECT , INSERT 
        and DELETE SQL Operations. I used the Microsoft sample database Northwind to 
        show few columns of the Customer table depending on the selection made in the 
        drop down list. For insertion, I used few form fields such as&nbsp; textboxes 
        and buttons and using the values that the users input, I added these values to 
        the database using the INSERT command in SQL. Also, DELETE command was used by 
        me to delete a particular entry from the database. Took care of certain boundary 
        conditions that might lead to SQL Exceptions. Hope you like the experiment !!
