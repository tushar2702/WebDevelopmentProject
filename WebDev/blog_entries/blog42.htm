        Worked on testing each file individually against any kind of failures that could 
        occur. Tested almost everything and resolved all the issues that were there. 
        Added few more content on my homepage.

        Since I am done with my project, I also performed another experiment out of 
        curiosity. I wanted to learn how to embed Google Search using Google API. I came 
        across this experiment in Bhakti Achlerkar&#39;s website and I wanted to learn the 
        basic things how to use a Google Search API. So, I went on to read the 
        documentation by Google and it was pretty straight forward to understand 
        everything. Just an experiment out of curiosity!!</p>
