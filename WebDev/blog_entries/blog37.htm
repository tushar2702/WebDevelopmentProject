        Further in my project...</p>
    <p>
        I have created the Dining web page where I show all the different restaurants in 
        my hotel and also the top meals that I suggest. I have done few things here.
        First, I have used my AJAX slideshow experiment where there is a slideshow of 
        the images of the restaurants and dining related pictures on the Dining 
        homepage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, once you click on the button &quot;Different types of cuisines that 
        we offer!&quot; you will get all of them. This I have done using ASP.NET repeater and 
        I retrieve this data from an XML file. Third, there is another link for getting 
        the top specials for each restaurant. Here you got to choose one of the 
        restaurants and you get 3 top suggested special meals pertaining to that 
        restaurant. For this I had stored these values in the database and I retrieve 
        using SQL.</p>
    <p>
        Also, I performed an experiment for updating data using editable gridview.
        I performed this experiment out of curiosity to try how to use editable 
        gridviews. Intially I was how does the edit button works how does it create 
        editable text boxes but it was Prasad Chawan's experiment that helped me 
        understand how easy this could be!</p>
    <p>
        In this experiment, first I created a table called PersonTest in my database 
        having fields such as person id, first name, last name, location and company. 
        Now gridview is so beautiful that it provides a property called 
        AutoGenerateEditButton which internally does the work of creating the edit 
        button and its functionality. This make it so easy to work this out! Now you can 
        go ahead and edit the person's first name, last name, location and company and 
        the same will be reflected in the PersonTest table in my database.
        I have also used the Update Panel control of Ajax so that when I click on edit, 
        only the Gridview gets refreshed and not the entire page.</p>
