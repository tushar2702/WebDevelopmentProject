        Further in my project.....</p>
    <p>
        I was on the &quot;Reservations&quot; page. Now what I wanted to do was to check for 
        availability of rooms. So, I now have designed and created my database. My 
        database has two tables for now. One is &quot;Room&quot; table which shows the rooms that 
        are there in the hotel with details such as room number and type of room. The 
        second table is &quot;Booked_Room&quot; which has all the rooms that are booked. This has 
        columns such as room number,checkin date and checkout date for now.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have written a SQL query to check for availability of rooms. I have currently 
        populated nine rooms in the Rooms table and few in the booked_room table. It is 
        a big query and took time to figure out. I also had one mistake in the query 
        which I noticed today and I have rectified it. It now works fine. The user needs 
        to just enter the checkin and checkout date and room type and he can check for 
        availability of rooms.</p>
