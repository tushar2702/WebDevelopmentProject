        The experiment that I always wanted to perform is finally there! The experiment 
        sends Emails using ASP.NET and I used the System.Net.Mail namespace for this.</p>
    <p>
&nbsp;I have created two text-boxes for the input of the &quot;from email address&quot; and the 
        &quot;to email address&quot;. The subject and the body of the email for this experiment is 
        fixed. When you click on send email button, the email is successfully sent to 
        the desired recipient only if the email is present and is a valid Gmail address.
    </p>
    <p>
        The reason why only Gmail address works is that I have used only the Gmail Smtp 
        Mail Server. I have also printed an error message which shows the exact type of 
        error why the message wasn&#39;t sent!
    </p>
    <p>
        IMPORTANT NOTE: The message is sometimes delivered in your spam folder. So, 
        don&#39;t forget to check your spams!!!! Have fun :))</p>
