Hotel Website in ASP.NET

This was a project during the course CS 5610 (Web Development). I created my personal website and a final term project which was a hotel website in ASP.NET. I learnt many new web technologies when I performed various experiments on varied technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, ASP.NET, C#, AJAX, etc. and used these to build my project. My website is up and running successfully!
